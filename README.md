# General Assembly Project-1-Street-Rat-Runner


My game is a canvas style player running game.
The user plays as a rat and has to use the left, right, and up key to get through the streets while avoiding coliding with cats, traps, and poison.
The goal is to make it through the game in two minutes without getting a score higher than 500.
